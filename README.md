# Code Institute Startup Academy

This project represents the idea of how the Academy's website would look like and the value that it would provide to students and graduates.

The Code Institute Startup Academy is a project idea that involves implementing a startup programme within Code Institute's organisation, to leverage the talent that goes through their courses regularly.

The mission of the Code Institute Startup Academy is to provide access to knowledge, community and tools that will allow CI students and graduates to start a startup and improve their probabilities of success, regardless of who and where they are.

_This is for educational purposes only._
